[build]

1. Base Directory: Tells Netlify where the main code repository starts

(Netlify will cd into 'frontend' before running the build command)

base    = "frontend"

2. Build Command: Runs the script defined in frontend/package.json

command = "npm run build"

3. Publish Directory: Where the compiled files (the dashboard) are located

publish = "frontend/build"

4. Functions Directory: Tells Netlify where to find the serverless function code

functions = "functions"

Configuration for Functions Runtime Environment

[functions]

Use esbuild for faster function bundling

node_bundler = "esbuild"

CRITICAL STEP: API Endpoint Rewrites

This tells Netlify to intercept requests to /api/v1/environment/* and forward

them to the corresponding Serverless Function handler.
