[build]

Assuming the root of your repository (where Netlify starts) contains the 'frontend' and 'functions' folders.

FIX: Simplifying base to "frontend" to match standard Netlify deployment practice.

base    = "frontend"

Functions directory (relative to the repository root, which is correct if the functions folder is at the root)

functions = "functions"

Build command to execute (relative to the base directory)

command = "npm run build"

Publish directory (relative to the base directory)

publish = "build"

Configuration for Functions Runtime Environment

[functions]
node_bundler = "esbuild"

CRITICAL: API Endpoint Rewrites (for Netlify to call the functions securely)
