## 🌎 EcoWatch Environmental Dashboard

This project is a modern, full-stack application designed to provide users with real-time weather, air quality data (AQI), and a 7-day forecast for any specific location. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio piece demonstrating proficiency in modern JavaScript frameworks, secure API handling, and serverless deployment.

Live Demo: https://ecowatch-dashboard.netlify.app/

## ✨ Key Features

Full-Stack Architecture: Separated React client and Node.js Serverless Functions backend.

Secure API Integration: Data fetched live from OpenWeatherMap (Weather, Forecast, and Air Pollution APIs). API key is secured via Netlify Environment Variables.

Dynamic UX: Application background smoothly transitions based on the current weather condition (e.g., Clear Sky, Rain, Thunderstorm).

Interactive Units: Toggle button allows instant switching between Fahrenheit (°F) and Celsius (°C).

Advanced Data Visualization: Custom-built vertical bar graph visualizes Air Quality Index (AQI) levels (1-5), clearly indicating risk level.

Robust Error Handling: Specific error messages guide the user on how to correctly format search queries (City, State Code, Country Code).
